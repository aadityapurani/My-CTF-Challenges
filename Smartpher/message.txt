Hi Wooble hackers,
I wrote a super secure message encryption system to secure our communication so that FeeNetwork couldn't get our secret access to the chamber. 
The code to our secret chamber access code is given below which I generated from our system

I combined blockchain and crypto to make double sure everything is good. I attach you other file, but I was too lazy to finish it though. Also, to access the chamber please decrypt the above access code and wrap with flag{...}

Thanks,
Wooble Team
